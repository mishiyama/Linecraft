# LineCraft

**LineCraft** is a minimal and focused repository for building foundational Machine Learning and AI algorithms from scratch.

The goal here is simple: to understand the core mechanics of algorithms by implementing them in the most direct and transparent way possible. This is a learning-first project — not about perfection, but about progress through code.

---



## Objectives

- Understand ML algorithms by writing them manually
- Avoid black-box solutions and abstracted libraries (where feasible)
- Keep the codebase clean, readable, and beginner-friendly
- Document key steps to reinforce understanding
